high-fidelity reliability Simulator IMproved (SIM)

    This is a simulator for evaluating RAID reliability.
    SIM is similar to High-Fideltiy Reliability Simulator (see http://www.kaymgee.com/Kevin_Greenan/Software.html), but 10x faster.
    SIM also has a more accurate Latent Sector Error model.
